Then part two is going to be the actual monitoring part. It takes about four hours to start monitoring, but after that, it'll be available for you in real time and that's just so we can go scrape all the data off the social sites.

      "During a sales call, Greg from Marin Transitions Partner spoke with Eliza from ACME Co. Greg introduced his company and asked about Eliza's position and the size of ACME Co's marketing team. Eliza mentioned that ACME Co has 45 employees and a marketing team of seven. Greg also asked about ACME Co's technology stack and social media activity. Eliza expressed that ACME Co has no visibility into what customers are saying about them on social media and that this lack of transparency is a pain point for them. She estimated that having this transparency could help them close one more deal per month, worth around $50,000. Eliza expressed interest in a tool that provides social monitoring and visibility into their market. ACME Co is considering two vendors, including Marin Transitions Partner, and the evaluation process involves presenting recommendations to the CEO and conducting a legal and security review. Eliza mentioned that they are also considering Hootsuite. Greg thanked Eliza for her support and discussed the implementation process, which should take about half a day's work. The call ended with Greg scheduling a follow-up meeting and expressing his excitement.\n"

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Yeah, absolutely. And would you or I guess, let me rephrase how valuable would it be to you to understand what customers are saying about your brand in real time? \n",

      "Eliza (ACME Co): Yes, there is a legal and security review as part of the process which would be conducted by our in house council. So you could send through your terms at any point and we could get ahead of that review if that would be… helpful. \n",

      "\n",
      "Greg (Marin Transitions Partner): Absolutely. So the implementation process is really in two parts. Part number one is just gonna be a about an hour long session with one of our implementation partners and your head of social media that's just to make sure that your accounts get set up and that we're doing the tracking properly. Then part two is going to be the actual monitoring part. It takes about four hours to start monitoring, but after that, it'll be available for you in real time and that's just so we can go scrape all the data off the social sites.
